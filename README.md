Supporting Entrepreneurship with Decentralized Pre-Seed Funding.


dAppFund(Decentralized Application Fund) is a decentralized investing website that utilizes Web 3 technology and smart contracts to provide a secure and transparent platform for fundraising. The website is designed to allow individuals or groups to create fundraising campaigns for a variety of purposes, such as charitable causes, entrepreneurial ventures, creative projects, and more. Unlike traditional investing platforms, which rely on centralized intermediaries to manage transactions and funds, our platform uses smart contracts to automate the process and ensure transparency, security, and trust.


Basically, smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain network, such as Ethereum. They act as a set of rules and conditions that govern the behaviour of the platform, allowing users to interact with each other and with the platform in a decentralized manner. This means that the platform operates without the need for a central authority, reducing the risk of fraud and improving the efficiency of the process.


The platform will be built on a decentralized network, meaning that will operates without a central authority or intermediary. Instead, the platform uses smart contracts, which are self-executing computer programs that are stored on a blockchain, to manage and automate the fundraising process.

## Get startup funding with blockchain technology !


Blockchain is a reliable and decentralized database that facilitates secure and tamper-proof record-keeping. Many startups find it useful for raising funds due to its efficiency and transparency. By using blockchain, startups can create digital tokens that represent shares or debts for the company, which can be traded to provide liquidity to early investors. Moreover, startups can leverage blockchain for an initial coin offering (ICO) to receive cryptocurrency-based crowdfunding, generating early-stage funds without giving away equity.


One of the main advantages of dAppFund is that it provides a transparent and secure fundraising process, as all transactions are recorded on the blockchain, and the smart contracts are designed to operate automatically, without the need for a central authority or intermediary. This reduces the risk of fraud or mismanagement and provides greater accountability and transparency for both campaign creators and backers.


Overall, the dAppFund project aims to leverage the power of Web 3 and blockchain technology to provide a decentralized and secure platform for crowdfunding, promoting innovation and collaboration while minimizing the risk of fraud and misuse of funds.

## Methodology

While developing our ICO, our main focus was to make it secure and user-friendly. To achieve this, we chose to use the standard ERC20 token template to create a fungible token.
Our tokens are built on Solidity, a popular programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. To ensure the quality and reliability of our code, we rigorously tested it multiple times using the Remix IDE. This allowed us to identify and address any issues or bugs before deployment, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience for our investors.
This allowed us to establish a strong foundation for our token design and ensure its compatibility with other platforms. In addition, we built our website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create an intuitive and easy-to-navigate user interface. Our aim was to make the ICO accessible and understandable to everyone, regardless of their technical background.

For companies looking to create an ICO for initial fundraising, it is essential to submit a clear and compelling explanation of their product's ideology. This helps in backing their valuation and token value.

Frontend:

	1.1. Our website is built using a combination of modern web dev technologies that helped us achieve a seamless user experience.
    
    1.2. We used pure HTML and CSS to structure and design the frontend of our website. 
    
    1.3. JavaScript was utilized to add dynamic functionalities and interactivity to our web pages, making them more engaging and 
    user-friendly.

Backend:

	2.1. We created our own ERC20 token “dAppCoin(DC)” using Solidity programming language and rigorous testing of the smart 
    contract was conducted on Remix IDE, using various testnets such as Sepolia and Polygon Mumbai.
    
    2.2. We then deployed them using HardHat, an open-source development environment for building and testing smart contracts.

Google Cloud Service:

	3.1. We opted for GCP AMD Instance T2D for the deployment of our website. The T2D instances were preferred over N2D as they
    are suitable for general-purpose workloads that require consistent performance and also due to their lower cost and 
    sufficient performance for most general-purpose workloads.
    
    3.2. We have integrated Firebase(A Google Cloud Service), which is a set of backend cloud computing services and application
    development platforms provided by Google Cloud, for our Investor Login and SignUp feature.
    
    3.3. We used Dialogflow to develop our chatbot that facilitates investor navigation on our website and offers assistance in 
    answering common questions related to the services we provide.


Conclusion:

	Our tech stack represents a perfect blend of frontend and backend technologies that work together seamlessly to provide
    our users with a seamless experience.
